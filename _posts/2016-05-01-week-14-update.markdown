## Current Status ##

LAST ONE

### What did you do this past week? ###

This last week my team and I focused on getting our presentation sorted out, as
well as finishing up the page which exercised the meteorite landing's API, of
which I mainly handled polishing up the front end.

### What's in your way? ###

Currently I have no blockers, besides studying for the exam and the presentation
on Monday.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week our group presents, and then we have the final exam on Thursday, so
most of my work will be preparing for that exam.

## Course Reflections ##

This is the last week of the course and the presentation is right around the
corner. One of my largest complaints about the projects revolves around the
tools we had to use, specifically the docker hosting site Carina. We found it
to be incredibly unreliable and frustraing that it was the hosting site of
choice for the class, though we inevitably moved off of it.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week this week is [Docker Cloud][docker], a docker hosting
solution run by the same people who maintain Docker itself. It's incredibly
easy to use, very stable, and works with a variety of hosting providers. I've
used it with my startup and several times recreationally, and it's very easy to
use and very reliable in it's performance.
