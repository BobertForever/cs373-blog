## Current Status ##

This is my 2nd late post; I left early Friday morning and this completely
slipped my mind again!

### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week I formed a group for the next set of projects and we discussed
how we were going to approach it and talked about some initial pieces of work
and what technologies we'd use.

### What's in your way? ###

Nothing is currently blocking me at this time.

### What will you do next week? ###

This next week is spring break, so I'll be enjoying San Diego and LA :)

## Course Reflections ##

After getting the exam grade back, I'm a bit dissapointed in my grade. I'd like
to know what I got wrong to justify it but I know I can still make a decent
grade in the course regardless.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week this week is [Flask migrate][flaskmigrate]. It's a tool for
managing database versions in Flask applications, since there's not a large ORM
watching over the database schema and versions like there is in other
application frameworks like Rails. My team has disucssed using it for our
projects so we can keep our local development in sync with each other.
