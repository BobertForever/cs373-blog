This is my first class blog entry for CS 373, Software Engineering. I intend to
keep up with the weekly blogs for the entirety of the class.

## Current status ##

### What did you do this past week? ###

This week was very light in terms of coursework. In the first day of class, we
went over the syllabus and what's expected of us in the course, and in the
second lecture we were given our first quiz over some basic python3, and then
went over the first project. I've gotten a good start on the first project,
finishing up the setup steps (creating my necessary github repo and Travis
accout), and done most of the initial coding required of us for the project.

### What's in your way? ###

Since we've only just started the course, there's not much in my way yet. I
expect to spend some more time this week on the first project but don't forsee
any complications as I work on it.

### What will you do next week? ###

Since I've already gotten a good start on the first project, all that I have
left to do is finish it up the coding and write more tests to verify
correctness, and to pass those tests off to the public class test repo. When I
started the project I gave myself an initial time estimate of 2 hours, and I
feel comfortable at about 30 minutes of work in I will be able to meet or beat
that estimate for this project.

## Course Reflections ##

From reading the course syllabus, I'm very fortunate to be familiar with most
of the technologies we'll be using for the duration of the class (including
interning at Rackspace, the hosting platform I assume we'll be using later) so
I'm hoping to learn more about these things and hone my abilities throught the
semester. I feel confident from the first quiz about my ability to perform well
on them throughout the semester (as long as I keep up with the work), and the
same goes for the exams and projects. The exams being on our computers is a bit
new and weird to me, though I have to admit, it's not the strangest thing I've
had a professor pull before and I'm excited to try it out.

## Tip of the week ##

One technology I've been using extensively lately is Facebook's
[GraphQL][graphql], a spec released for a query language. In particular, I've
been using a [ruby implementation of the spec][graphql-ruby] for a startup I
help out with, and in my spare time writing [my own][graphql-rust]
implementation of the spec in [Rust][rust], Mozilla's system language. I think
it's an amazing way to write applications (both web and mobile), and the
GraphQL engine itself is a very fun software problem to work on.
