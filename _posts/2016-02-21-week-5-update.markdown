## Current Status ##

### What did you do this past week? ###

This last week, my partner Jena and I completed Project 2, after just barely
passing the 1.0 requirement of RMSE and finishing off the other requirements.
We found some things pretty difficult to test without proper mocking, like code
paths which only get executed in certain environments. However, we got code
coverage to about 98%, only missing a few lines. This project was more difficult
than the previous in terms of the code, but we were much more comfortable with
the way the projects worked in the class now that we've done a project before.

### What's in your way? ###

I current have no blockers besides work for other classes and studying for the
quizes like normal.

### What will you do next week? ###

This week I intend to just continue to keep up with the course work and try to
stay ahead of things. I realistically have a lot on my plate so the more up
to date I stay the better.

## Course Reflections ##

One of the quizes this last week was slightly frsutrating because I felt like
the three minutes wasn't enough, but still I did pretty decent on them this
week. I believe still the most important part of this class will be just staying
up to date on the content and the assignments when them come out.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week this week is [Iterm2's beta for V3][ITerm]. After switching,
I find it to be a lot faster and a lot more powerful and polished than the
previous version. I've been using Iterm2 as my main terminal for a while and
this is a serious improvement over the last version.
