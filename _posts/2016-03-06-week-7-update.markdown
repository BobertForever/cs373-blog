## Current Status ##

### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week I studied for and took the first exam. I felt like my studying
was adequate and I did decently on the exam, but more imporantly, I know what
to expect for the next one.

### What's in your way? ###

Nothing is currently blocking me at this time.

### What will you do next week? ###

This next week I will start working on the next project and hopefully wrap up
work on all my other classes as spring break is coming up. I unfortunately
won't be able to attend class on Friday since I have a flight that morning which
leaves long before class starts, but I have yet to miss a class so I'm not all
too worried.

## Course Reflections ##

The exam this past week was about what I expected in terms of difficulty and
content. Though I know I did well on most of it, there was a specific question
that I know I messed the algorithm up as soon as I walked out of the exam, but
that's not the first time that's happened. Having the exam on Canvas was
different, but I wouldn't say it's better in any specific way.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week for this week is [Trello][trello]. Trello is a tool you can
use to keep track of what you and your team needs to get done for a project or
product. I've used it a lot lately freelancing and in startups and have found
it incredibly useful for keeping track of things, especially when there's
multiple people working on the same set of issues.
