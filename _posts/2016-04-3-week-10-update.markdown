## Current Status ##


### What did you do this past week? ###

This last week I focused mainly on class work and planning out things for the
last 2 phases of our group project.

### What's in your way? ###

Currently I have no blockers, and am planning to get the next part of the
project knocked out soon.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week I intend to work closely with my partners and finish up the next phase
of the project as quickly as we can. We hammered through the first phase with
a pretty good outcome, so I believe we can continue moving forward with that
velocity for the final phases.

## Course Reflections ##

The course continues to be a lot of python, sometimes bordering on feeling like
it's just trivia regarding python and other things like XML, but for the most
part the content is managable. The speakers we've had so far have been some
of my least favorite lectures, mostly because after 3 internships I've heard
whatever topics they're going to be covering regarding how working at a company
is like and other details of the sort.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week is [Habitica][habitica], a task manager app which gamifies
serveral aspects of your life. It's a fun way to try and stay on top of my tasks
and even comes with a "group" feature where you can work to complete your daily
goals together with friends. It's a very interesting take on a task manager and
is definately work a check if none others have been working for you, as was the
case for me.
