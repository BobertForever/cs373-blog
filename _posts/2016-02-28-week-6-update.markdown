## Current Status ##

This post is a bit late; I was out of town all weekend and it totally slipped my
mind since I didn't do it when I normally do. Sorry!

### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week was mostly just class and casually preparing for our exam next
week. I plan to just go over my notes leading until until the exam but will
probably spend a few dedicated hours this week preparing.

### What's in your way? ###

I current have no blockers besides work for other classes and studying for the
quizes and exam.

### What will you do next week? ###

This week I intend to study for the exam on Thursday as much as possible. A lot
of this class is just python knowledge so I want to make sure I have a good
understanding of what can be on the exam.

## Course Reflections ##

My biggest problem with this class so far is the quizzes and how most of the
context seems to revolve around python. A lot of times during the quizzes I feel
like I'm being quizzed on very pedantic python semantics which are easy to get
mixed up. It has me slightly worried about the exam, despite having a strong
knowledge of python 3 prior to the class.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week is [Docker][docker], a linux container service which is great
for deployment and isolated command execution. I've used it for several projects
before, from running arbitrary code in a secure setting to deploying entire
applications. It's really fun and exciting to work with and I've enjoyed it so
far.
