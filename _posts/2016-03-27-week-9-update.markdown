## Current Status ##

This post is super late; I had started writing it and then it totally slipped
my mind to post it. My tip of the week should probably be a task manager next
week.

### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week my team and I finished part one of the project. We had a
collective late start so we ended up hammering it all out in a fairly small
amount of time, but in the end, it turned out pretty well. We used React and
React-router for most of the UI, which was the part I mainly worked on.

### What's in your way? ###

I have nothing in my way coming up, as the project was just due.

### What will you do next week? ###

Next week I hope to get a start on the next phase of the project with my
partners, and continue to focus on class.

## Course Reflections ##

This is an interesting part of the course, as it's moving away from direct
facts of python and moving more into different topics which are relevant to
SWE, although we're learing them in the context of python. It's interesting,
though from the past part of the course I'm wondering how much of the content
I will have learned before, either in my internships or other classes.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week this week is the [Github Expore page][ghexplore]. Though it's
not a specific technology, I like to personally frequent it to see what new and
trending projects are going on in the open source community. It's a neat way to
see what's going on and find cool new libraries and tech to use.
