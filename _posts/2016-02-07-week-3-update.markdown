## Current Status ##

### What did you do this past week? ###

This past week I completely finished and submitted Project 1, after combing
through the requirement as many times as I could to make sure I didn't miss
anything. I overshot my estimate by about an hour, which I attribute to just
taking it slower than normal to make sure I got all of the requirements.

### What's in your way? ###

With project 2 on the horizion I'll need to find a partner and go over the
requirments in the next few days so I can jump into it.

### What will you do next week? ###

Since project 2 is out, I expect myself to spend a lot of time in that getting
it done sooner rather than later. Past that, I only expect to be doing typical
coursework.

## Course Reflections ##

After learning from my mistake in Week 2, I dedicated some time to read before
class and did much better on the quizzes. Doing the readings, they become a lot
easier (as one would expect).

So far, a lot of what we've covered in class has been review for me for most of
the concepts, though some of the minor things, like the nuances of types have
been neat tidbits of information I did not know prior to lecture. I expect a
lot of the class to be like this, where I've done the concept before but learn
some new tool or feature.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week this week is [VirtualEnv][virtualenv], a python dependency
and versioning tool manager. Instead of installing all dependencies in the
global scope, you setup a virtual environment which isolates all your installs
and python version to the project, making it super portable and free of issues
like ilibrary version conflict.
