## Current Status ##

### What did you do this past week? ###

In the past week, my partner Jena and I got a good start on Project 2, doing
most of the work necessary so we can just finish up the prediction algorithm
in the week. This includes most of the project preperations, setup, and
framework, as well as going through most of the project requirements except
for the actual correctness of the code.

### What's in your way? ###

We currently have no blockers on the project, except for time. Jena and I plan
to meet up early this week to finish the project as soon as possible so we have
the rest of the week for other assignments.

### What will you do next week? ###

Most work this week will just be trying to finish up Project 2 as quickly as
possible with proper considerations for quality. We have done most of the bulk
work in preparation so hopefully we don't encounter much outside of the usual
software bugs.

## Course Reflections ##

This week I feel like I've actually gotten in the groove of the class. Despire
it being in the morning on M/W/F and it being my only class on those days, it's
a good "get out of bed" class and I find the lectures informative, if not a bit
verbose at times.

## Tip of the week ##

My tip of the week this week is [Gigster][gigster], a freelancing website for
developers. Instead of the tradition freelancing style, where the developer
seeks out jobs and contacts the teams, Gigster does a lot of that for you so
you can focus on the project at hand. I just started freelancing this semester
with them and it's a ton of fun and really easy to get started with.
